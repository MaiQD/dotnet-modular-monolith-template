# App: A Customizable Home Workout Tracker

## 1. Introduction

**App** is a web-based productivity application designed to empower individuals to stay active and achieve their fitness goals from the comfort of their homes. It provides robust tools for customizing workout experiences, tracking progress, and maintaining motivation with minimal external equipment.

**Target User:** Individuals seeking to maintain an active lifestyle at home, ranging from beginners to those with some fitness experience, who value structured workouts and clear progress visualization.

**Core Value Proposition:** To offer a highly customizable, easy-to-use, and motivating platform for planning, executing, and tracking home-based workouts, providing visual feedback on progress to drive consistency.

## 2. Application Features (Functional Requirements)

**App** will offer the following key features:

- **User Authentication:**
    - Secure user login via **Google OAuth 2.0** for a seamless onboarding experience.
    - Initial admin account assignment via a configured whitelist of Google emails.
    - First-time onboarding flagged and surfaced on the dashboard.
- **User Profile Management:**
    - Ability to track and update user information: weight, height, and unit preference (metric/imperial).
    - **Progress Visualization:** Historical graphs of weight and BMI changes over time.
- **Custom Exercise Management:**
    - Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own custom exercises.
    - Each exercise will include: Name, Description, **Muscle Groups** (selectable from pre-defined/user-defined list), **Equipment** (selectable from pre-defined/user-defined list), and a **Video Link** for demonstration.
    - Emphasis on bodyweight and limited-equipment exercises suitable for home.
- **Custom Routine Creation & Management:**
    - Users can build personalized workout routines by combining their custom exercises.
    - Each exercise within a routine specifies: desired Sets, Reps (flexible string input), and **Rest Time** (in seconds) between sets.
    - Ability to reorder exercises within a routine.
    - **Smart Routine Suggestions:** Potentially generate quick workouts based on duration, target muscle groups, and available equipment.
    - **Pre-built Home Workout Templates:** Offer curated routines for various home workout scenarios.
- **Workout Logging:**
    - Users can start a routine or an ad-hoc workout session.
    - During a session, users can log actual sets, reps, and weight for each exercise.
    - Integrated **rest timer** that automatically starts after logging a set.
    - Ability to add session-specific notes.
- **Progress Visualization Dashboard:**
    - **Workout Streak** tracking.
    - **Total Workouts Completed** count.
    - **Trend Graphs:** Visualizing progress for specific exercises (e.g., max reps for push-ups over time).
    - **Personal Bests** tracking and display.
    - Summaries of total workout duration or muscle group focus.
- **Motivation & Engagement:**
    - Workout reminders/notifications.
    - Achievements or badges for reaching milestones (e.g., "First 7-day streak").
    - Post-workout summaries with key achievements.
- **Admin Role for Master Data:**
 - **Smart Exercise Suggestions:**
     - Query endpoint returns a list of suggested exercises for the current user, ranked by fit to preferences (focus muscles, available equipment). Initial heuristic is simple scoring; future iterations may consider history and progression.

    - An administrative role will be implemented to manage and populate the global lists of **Muscle Groups** and **Equipment**.
    - Users can select from global lists, and a mechanism will be in place for users to add *their own* private muscle groups or equipment if not in the global list.
 - **Billing & Premium (Future):**
     - Premium plans with Stripe (Checkout, Customer Portal), plan gating via policies, and subscription webhooks.

## 3. Architectural Design

**App** will be built as a **Modular Monolith** using **ASP.NET Core** for the backend API and **Vue.js** for the frontend user interface, leveraging **MongoDB** as the database.

### 3.1. Architectural Pattern: Modular Monolith

- **Description:** The application is structured into loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules (vertical slices), each owning its domain, application logic, and infrastructure concerns. All modules are deployed as a single, unified ASP.NET Core application.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each module focuses on a specific business capability (Users, Exercises, Routines, Workout Logs).
    - **Improved Maintainability:** Changes in one module are less likely to affect others directly.
    - **Scalability:** Allows for independent development and potential future migration to microservices if needed.
    - **Simplified Deployment:** Deployed as a single unit, reducing operational overhead compared to distributed systems.

### 3.2. Project Structure

The Visual Studio solution (`App.sln`) will contain the following projects:

`App.sln
├── App.Api/                           <-- Main ASP.NET Core Web API entry point
│   ├── Program.cs

**Project Dependencies:**

- `App.Api` references all `.Application` projects.
- `.Infrastructure` projects reference their corresponding `.Domain` and `.Application` projects, and `App.SharedKernel`.
- `.Domain` projects reference `App.SharedKernel`.
- `.Application` projects reference `App.SharedKernel`.
- `.Tests` projects reference the `Application`, `Domain`, `Infrastructure` projects they are testing, and `App.SharedKernel`.

### 3.3. Core Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework:** ASP.NET Core Web API (latest LTS version, e.g., .NET 8).
- **Frontend Framework:** Vue.js (latest stable version, e.g., Vue 3) with Vite for build tooling.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework).
- **Charting:** Chart.js (JavaScript charting library with Vue.js wrappers).

## 4. Core Technical Patterns & Libraries

### 4.1. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

- **Purpose:** To separate read (Query) and write (Command) operations, optimizing each for its specific responsibility.
- **Implementation:** Leverages **MediatR** as an in-process message dispatcher.
    - Commands encapsulate intent to change state (e.g., `CreateExerciseCommand`).
    - Queries encapsulate intent to retrieve data (e.g., `GetUserRoutinesQuery`).
    - Dedicated handlers (`IRequestHandler`) process each Command/Query.
- **Benefits:** Clearer separation of concerns, independent optimization of read/write paths, improved testability.

### 4.2. Outbox Pattern

- **Purpose:** To ensure atomicity and reliability when performing a database operation and publishing a domain event (e.g., updating a `WorkoutLog` and publishing a `WorkoutCompletedEvent`). Prevents data inconsistency due to "dual-writes."
- **Implementation:**
    - An `outboxMessages` MongoDB collection stores events as part of the same database transaction as the main data change.
    - A background `IHostedService` (Outbox Processor) polls `outboxMessages`, publishes events to a message broker (or directly to consumers internally), and marks them as processed.
- **Benefits:** Guarantees eventual consistency, robustness against application crashes.

### 4.3. Result Pattern

- **Purpose:** To explicitly handle and communicate outcomes (success or failure) of operations without relying solely on throwing exceptions for expected business rule violations or "not found" scenarios.
- **Implementation:** `Result` and `Result<TValue>` objects defined in `App.SharedKernel`.
    - Methods (especially Command/Query handlers) return `Result<T>` indicating success with a value, or failure with an error message.
- **Benefits:** Explicit error handling, predictable API for consumers, improved readability, reduced exception overhead.

### 4.4. Mapperly

- **Purpose:** High-performance, compile-time code generation for mapping between DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and domain models.
- **Implementation:** Using Mapperly's source generator capabilities within each module's `Application` project for mapping interfaces.
- **Benefits:** Eliminates runtime reflection overhead (faster), type-safe mapping, reduced boilerplate code.

### 4.5. FluentValidation

- **Purpose:** Provides a fluent and expressive API for defining robust validation rules for input DTOs and Commands.
- **Implementation:** Validator classes (e.g., `CreateExerciseCommandValidator`) are created for commands/queries, integrated with MediatR's pipeline behaviors.
- **Benefits:** Decouples validation logic from business logic, improved testability of validation rules, clear error messages.

### 4.6. Centralized Error Handling

- **Purpose:** To provide consistent and structured error responses from the API, preventing sensitive information leakage and improving client-side error handling.
- **Implementation:** ASP.NET Core's built-in Exception Handling Middleware or custom middleware to catch unhandled exceptions globally and map them to appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error payloads. This also integrates with the `Result` pattern, mapping `Result.Failure` to HTTP responses.
- **Benefits:** Uniform error format, better user experience, simplified debugging.

### 4.7. API Versioning

- **Purpose:** To allow for controlled evolution of the API by supporting multiple versions simultaneously, preventing breaking changes for existing clients.
- **Implementation:** Using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning` package to version API endpoints (e.g., via URL segments like `/v1/exercises`).
- **Benefits:** Smoother API updates, client compatibility, easier maintenance of long-lived APIs.

### 4.8. Structured Logging with Serilog

- **Purpose:** To provide rich, queryable logs for monitoring application behavior, diagnosing issues, and auditing.
- **Implementation:** Configuring Serilog in the `App.Api` project, using its structured logging capabilities and various sinks (e.g., Console, File, Azure Application Insights).
- **Benefits:** Easier log analysis, improved observability, faster debugging in production.

### 4.9. Testing (xUnit.net, Moq, FluentAssertions)

- **Purpose:** To ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's logic through automated testing.
- **Implementation:**
    - **xUnit.net:** The primary unit testing framework. Dedicated test projects for each module (`App.Modules.X.Tests`).
    - **Moq:** A mocking library used to create mock objects for dependencies, isolating the code under test (e.g., mocking `IMongoCollection<T>`, `IMediator`).
    - **FluentAssertions:** An assertion library that provides a highly readable and fluent syntax for asserting test outcomes.
- **Benefits:** High code quality, regression prevention, faster development cycles.

## 5. Database Schema (MongoDB Collections)

All collections will implicitly include `_id` (ObjectId string), `createdAt` (UTC DateTime), and `updatedAt` (UTC DateTime) fields as standard.

 - **`users`**
    - `googleId` (String): Unique ID from Google. [Index]

   Design notes:
   - Unique within scope: `(name, isGlobal, userId)`; index `bodyRegion` for filtering.
   - Seeder upserts standard catalog; avoid duplicates via uniqueness.
### 5.1. Seed Data

- **Muscle Groups Seeding:**
  - Implement an idempotent seeder that upserts standard muscle groups at app startup.
  - Use unique index on `(name, isGlobal==true)`; set `parentId` links where applicable.
  - Store a deterministic key (e.g., slug) to allow safe updates.

Indexes:
- `muscleGroups`: `name` (unique within scope), `bodyRegion`, `parentId`.
- `users`: `email` (unique), `googleId`, `roles`.
- `userMetrics`: `{ userId: 1, date: -1 }`.
- `exercises`: `{ userId: 1, isGlobal: 1, name: 1 }`, `{ tags: 1 }`.

### 5.2. Billing (Future)

- **`subscriptions`**
  - `userId` (ObjectId): FK → `users`. [Unique per provider]
  - `provider` (String): e.g., "stripe".
  - `customerId` (String): Provider customer id.

  - `{ userId: 1, updatedAt: -1 }`.

### 5.3. Inbox (Event Idempotency) — Event-Driven Architecture

- **`inboxMessages`** (per subscriber/consumer)
  - `eventId` (String): Unique provider event id. [Unique per consumer]
  - `eventType` (String): Type discriminator.
  - `occurredOn` (Date): Event time (UTC).
  - `payload` (String): Raw JSON body.
  - `consumer` (String): Logical consumer name (e.g., `Exercises.SuggestionsProjector`).
  - `status` (String): pending|processed|failed.
  - `processedAt` (Date, nullable): When processed.
  - `attempts` (Number): Delivery attempts.
  - `error` (String, nullable): Last error.
  - `correlationId` (String, optional), `traceId` (String, optional)

  Indexes:
  - Unique `{ consumer: 1, eventId: 1 }`
  - `{ consumer: 1, status: 1, occurredOn: 1 }`

Per-module implementation
- Each module SHALL implement its own consumers and persist inbox entries with a unique `consumer` name.
- Consumer naming convention: `{Module}.{Component}`, e.g., `Exercises.SuggestionsProjector`, `Users.ProfileProjector`, `Billing.SubscriptionProjector`.
- Index creation for inbox MUST be added in each module’s installer (similar to how other module indexes are configured).
- Allowed storage strategies:
  - Single shared collection `inboxMessages` (recommended) with `consumer` disambiguation (as modeled above), or
  - Separate per-module collections (e.g., `inboxMessages.exercises`) using the same schema and indexes.
- Handlers MUST upsert `{ consumer, eventId }` before executing business logic to ensure idempotency, then update `status` and `processedAt`.

## 13. Event Broker Migration Plan (Later)

Phase 1 — Build with current design (now)
- Use Outbox on producers (`outboxMessages`) and document consumer-side Inbox schema.
- Keep events as DTO payloads with `eventId`, `eventType`, `occurredOn`, `correlationId`, `traceId` in the envelope.
- Implement features without a broker; cross-module side effects can be added later via outbox dispatcher.

Phase 2 — Introduce Event Bus abstraction
- Define `IEventBusPublisher`, `IEventBusSubscriber`, and `EventEnvelope` in `SharedKernel`.
- Add an Outbox dispatcher `BackgroundService` that reads unprocessed outbox entries and publishes `EventEnvelope` via `IEventBusPublisher`.
- Consumers subscribe through `IEventBusSubscriber` in each module installer and persist to Inbox before handling (idempotent).

Phase 3 — In-memory adapter (dev/default)
- Implement `InMemoryEventBus` for `IEventBus*` interfaces (simple pub/sub in-process). 
- Wire DI to in-memory bus for all environments initially.

Phase 4 — Cloud broker adapter
- Implement cloud adapter (e.g., Azure Service Bus/RabbitMQ) for `IEventBus*`.
- Externalize topics/queues in configuration; avoid broker-specific logic in business code.
- Swap DI to cloud adapter for staging/prod only; keep in-memory for local/testing.

Phase 5 — Operations & hardening
- Add DLQ, retries, and metrics dashboards on the broker side.
- Keep Outbox/Inbox for at-least-once semantics. Ensure handlers are idempotent.
- Load/perf test event throughput and backpressure.

### 13.1. Inbox Migration for Existing Modules (Now)

- Prereqs
  - Define an `InboxMessage` schema (fields per 5.3). Use a shared collection `inboxMessages` with `consumer` disambiguation.

- Users module
  1. Add DI binding for `inboxMessages` in `UsersModuleInstaller`.
  2. Create indexes: unique `{ consumer, eventId }`, `{ consumer, status, occurredOn }`.
  3. Introduce a small idempotency wrapper (decorator or base service) that:
     - Upserts `{ consumer, eventId }` with `status=pending`.
     - Executes handler.
     - Sets `status=processed`, `processedAt=UtcNow` (or `status=failed` with `error`).
  4. Apply wrapper to each consumer handler (e.g., projection updaters) and choose a `consumer` name like `Users.ProfileProjector`.

- Exercises module
  1. Add DI binding for `inboxMessages` in `ExercisesInfrastructureModule`.
  2. Create the same indexes.
  3. Reuse the idempotency wrapper.
  4. Apply to consumers (e.g., suggestions projector) with `consumer` name `Exercises.SuggestionsProjector`.

- Rollout order
  1. Add inbox bindings + indexes in all modules.
  2. Wrap consumers with idempotency.
  3. Enable outbox dispatcher (when built) to publish events.
  4. Monitor duplicates; adjust retry/backoff.

- Testing
  - Unit-test the wrapper (duplicate event processed once).
  - Integration-test: insert the same outbox event twice → single side effect.

 - **`equipment`**
    - `name` (String): Equipment name. [Unique per scope]
    - `isGlobal` (Boolean): Global vs user-defined.
    - `userId` (ObjectId, nullable): Present when `isGlobal=false`.

   Design notes:
   - Unique within scope: `(name, isGlobal, userId)`.
 - **`routines`**
    - `userId` (ObjectId): FK → `users`. [Index]
    - `name` (String): Routine name.
    - `description` (String, optional).
    - `exercises` (Array of Objects):
        - `exerciseId` (ObjectId): FK → `exercises`.
        - `sets` (Number): Target sets.
        - `reps` (String): Target reps (e.g., "5x5", "AMRAP").
        - `restTimeSeconds` (Number): Recommended rest.
        - `notes` (String, optional).

   Design notes:
   - Index `{ userId: 1, name: 1 }` helps lookups; consider unique per user optionally.
 - **`workoutLogs`**
    - `userId` (ObjectId): FK → `users`. [Index]
    - `routineId` (ObjectId, nullable): FK → `routines`.
    - `date` (Date): When performed (UTC). [Index]
    - `notes` (String, optional).
    - `exercisesPerformed` (Array of Objects):
        - `exerciseId` (ObjectId): FK → `exercises`.
        - `setsPerformed` (Array of Objects):
            - `setNumber` (Number): 1..N
            - `reps` (Number): Actual reps.
            - `weight` (Number): Actual weight.
            - `unit` (String): "kg" | "lbs".
            - `notes` (String, optional).
        - `exerciseNotes` (String, optional).

   Design notes:
   - Compound index `{ userId: 1, date: -1 }` for history queries and dashboards.
 - **`outboxMessages`**
    - `occurredOn` (Date): Event time (UTC). [Index]
    - `type` (String): Event type discriminator.
    - `data` (String): Serialized payload (JSON).
    - `processedDate` (Date, nullable): When processed.
    - `error` (String, nullable): Last processing error.
    - `retries` (Number): Retry count.
    - `correlationId` (String, optional).
    - `traceId` (String, optional).

   Design notes:
   - Index `{ processedDate: 1, occurredOn: 1 }` to efficiently poll unprocessed events.

## 6. Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication:** Handled exclusively via **Google OAuth 2.0**. Upon successful Google authentication, the backend issues a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** containing user identity and roles.
- **Authorization:**
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Users will have roles (e.g., "User", "Admin").
    - **Policy-Based Authorization:** ASP.NET Core policies will enforce access rules (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` for admin functionalities; custom policies for data ownership like "users can only manage their own exercises").
- **Admin Initiation:** The first admin account will be designated via a **Configuration/Environment Variable Whitelist**. Upon first login, if a user's Google email matches a whitelisted email, they will automatically be assigned the "Admin" role.

## 10. Onboarding Flow (Technical)

- **Triggering Condition:** `User.isOnboarded == false` on client; backend exposes this via `GetUserProfile`.
- **Data Capture:**
  - Update profile: display name, unit preference (existing `UpdateUserProfileCommand`).
  - Create baseline metric: weight (required), height (optional) via `AddUserMetricCommand` with current date.
  - Save preferences: equipment and focus muscles via a new `UpdateUserPreferencesCommand` (or extend profile update) that persists `availableEquipmentIds` and `focusMuscleGroupIds`.
- **Completion Flag:** Add `CompleteOnboardingCommand` (or reuse profile update + metrics creation) that sets `User.isOnboarded = true` and `onboardingCompletedAt = DateTime.UtcNow`.
- **Validation:** Use FluentValidation for onboarding DTOs (weight required if completing).
- **Mapping:** Use Mapperly to map onboarding DTOs to `UpdateUserProfileCommand` and `AddUserMetricCommand` inputs.
- **Security:** Endpoints protected by `SelfOrAdmin` policy.

## 11. Exercise Import API (CSV)

- **Endpoint (user library):** `POST /api/v1/exercises/import`
  - Auth: `User` or `Admin`.
  - Body: `multipart/form-data` with `file`, options: `{ overwriteOnNameMatch: bool, defaultDifficulty: string }`.
  - Behavior: Creates user-owned exercises; if `overwriteOnNameMatch` is true, updates matching by (name, userId).

- **Endpoint (global, Admin):** `POST /api/v1/exercises/import/global`
  - Auth: `AdminOnly`.
  - Behavior: Creates global exercises; if overwrite, match by name and `isGlobal=true`.

- **CSV Columns (expected):**
  - `name` (required)
  - `description`
  - `muscleGroups` (comma-separated; match by seeded names/aliases, create user-private if not found)
  - `equipment` (comma-separated; create user-private if not found)
  - `instructions` (pipe-separated steps)
  - `difficulty` (Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced|Expert)
  - `videoUrl`
  - `imageUrl`
  - `tags` (comma-separated)

- **Response:**
```json
{
  "total": 120,
  "created": 100,
  "updated": 10,
  "failed": 10,
  "errors": [
    { "row": 12, "reason": "name missing" },
    { "row": 45, "reason": "invalid difficulty" }
  ]
}
```

- **Implementation Notes:**
  - Stream parse CSV to avoid large memory; validate per row with FluentValidation.
  - Use Mapperly to map parsed rows to `CreateExerciseCommand`/`UpdateExerciseCommand`.
  - Normalize/trim case for name matching; support `aliases` mapping for muscle groups.
  - Wrap in a MediatR command `ImportExercisesFromCsvCommand` with a handler in Exercises.Infrastructure.

## 12. Clean Architecture & SOLID (Enforcement)

- Each handler, command, and query SHALL reside in its own file. Do not co-locate multiple handlers in one file.
- Domain/Application code SHALL not depend on Infrastructure types. Use interfaces and inject abstractions.
- Large handlers SHOULD extract orchestration/services to maintain SRP.

## 7. Development Environment Setup (Mac)

- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Package Manager:** Homebrew
- **Version Control:** Git
- **IDEs/Editors:**
    - **Backend:** Visual Studio Code (with C# extension), Visual Studio for Mac, or JetBrains Rider.
    - **Frontend:** Visual Studio Code (with Volar, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, ESLint, Prettier).
- **API Testing:** Postman or Insomnia.
- **Node.js Management:** NVM (Node Version Manager) for flexible Node.js version switching.
- **Local Database:** **MongoDB running in a Docker Compose container.**
    - `docker-compose.yml` will define the MongoDB service, mapping port `27017` to the host.
    - ASP.NET Core API will connect to `mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/WorkoutTrackerDb?authSource=admin`.
- **MongoDB GUI:** MongoDB Compass for inspecting local and Atlas databases.

## 8. Deployment Strategy (Zero-Cost Azure Focus)

The deployment strategy is entirely focused on leveraging **free tiers** of cloud services for a highly cost-effective solution, managed consistently via **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform**

## 9. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

A robust CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** will automate the entire software delivery process, ensuring consistency, reliability, and faster iterations.

- **Repository Structure:** A single monorepo is recommended (`App.ModularMonolith/`) containing `infra/`, all `.NET` projects, and `App.WebUI/`.
- **Separate Workflows:** Dedicated GitHub Actions workflows will be created for different concerns:
    1. **`infra-deploy.yml` (Infrastructure Pipeline):**
        - **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch affecting files within the `infra/` directory.
        - **Stages:** `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`.
        - **Secrets:** Azure Service Principal credentials, MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API keys, MongoDB database user credentials, initial admin email (all stored as GitHub Secrets).
    2. **`backend-ci-cd.yml` (Backend Application Pipeline):**
        - **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch (or Pull Request) affecting `.NET` project files (`.cs`, `.csproj`).
        - **Stages:**
            - `dotnet restore` (dependencies).
            - `dotnet build` (compilation).
            - `dotnet test` (runs xUnit.net unit tests).
            - `dotnet publish` (prepares for deployment).
            - `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` (deploys to Azure App Service).
        - **Secrets:** Azure Service Principal credentials.
    3. **`frontend-ci-cd.yml` (Frontend Application Pipeline):**
        - **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch (or Pull Request) affecting files within the `YourAppName.WebUI/` directory.
        - **Stages:**
            - `npm install` (frontend dependencies).
            - `npm run build` (builds Vue.js application into static files).
            - `azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1` (deploys static files to Azure Static Web Apps).
        - **Secrets:** `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` (generated by Azure Static Web Apps), `VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL` (environment variable to point to the deployed API URL).

This comprehensive technical document outlines the entire journey for building **App**, from its conceptual features to its robust deployment and CI/CD strategy.
